description: Tidy a repo after a task wraps - prune stale worktrees, delete plan files for merged PRs, and report what's left. Use when the user says "/housekeeping", "clean up the repo", "tidy up", or after a feature merges.

Routine cleanup pass. **Staged escalation**: pass 1 auto-removes only the obviously-safe stuff (merged-and-clean), then the user directs further passes ("kill X, Y, Z", "prune branches too", "leave only A and B"). Don't try to nuke everything in one shot — surface the risky candidates with their state and let the user call it.

## Mental model

- `git worktree remove --force <wt>` **preserves the branch ref** — unpushed commits stay on the branch. Only **uncommitted dirty files** are lost. This is what makes pass-2 ("kill the dirty ones") safe to do on user command without elaborate stash dances.
- `git worktree remove` already deletes the folder. `git worktree prune` only cleans stale admin entries under `.git/worktrees/` — there is no separate "prune the folders" step.
- `git branch -D` refuses branches currently checked out by a worktree (built-in safety). Lean on this when bulk-deleting — don't pre-filter the keepers, let git refuse them.

## Inputs the user may give you

- A scope hint: "just plans", "just worktrees", "everything", or a kill list ("nuke fix-db-migrations and local-demo").
- If the user has multiple Claude sessions running concurrently, ask once for active session IDs so you don't yank their worktrees. Otherwise assume current session only.

## Steps

### 1. Snapshot

```bash
git worktree list
ls plans/
```

### 2. Per-worktree state table

```bash
bash ~/.claude/lib/housekeeping-snapshot.sh
```

Output JSON: `{count, auto_removable:[...], needs_decision:[...], all:[...]}`. Each worktree has `{name, path, branch, lock, dirty, unpushed, pr_number, pr_state, pr_merged_at, auto_remove_safe}`.

Render `needs_decision` as a table for the user: `name | lock | branch | dirty=N | unpushed=N | PR=#NNN/STATE`.

### 3. Pass 1 — auto-remove safe worktrees

For each in `auto_removable` (lock unlocked/dead + dirty=0 + PR MERGED):

```bash
git worktree remove --force <path>
```

Then `git worktree prune`. Everything in `needs_decision` waits for user direction.

### 4. Plans — delete what's merged, keep what's load-bearing

Get the scan in one call — per-plan PR + branch + CLAUDE.md-reference state:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/housekeeping/lib/plans-triage.sh
```

Each plan emits: `PLAN <file> pr:<NNN|none> state:<...> branch:<gone|live|-> claudemd:<yes|no>`.
It only scans — you decide disposition over the rows:

- `state:MERGED` + `branch:gone` + `claudemd:no` → delete.
- `claudemd:yes` (phase orchestrators) → KEEP regardless of PR state.
- Plan matches active untracked work in the main checkout → KEEP (script
  can't see this — check yourself before deleting).
- `state:OPEN` / closed-without-merge → list it, ask the user.

### 5. Report — then wait for follow-ups

```
worktrees: removed N (merged+clean), kept M
  • <name>  — <one-line state>: dirty=X, unpushed=Y, PR=#NNN/STATE
plans:     removed N (merged), kept M (active/orchestrator)
branches:  not touched — <orphan branch list>; confirm before -D
```

Then **wait**. The user typically follows up with one of:

- *"kill X, Y, Z as well"* → just remove them (`git worktree remove --force`). Don't re-ask about dirty files — the kill list is the confirmation.
- *"prune branches too"* / *"leave only X and Y"* → run the branch sweep below.
- *"all done"* → stop.

### 6. Branch sweep (only on explicit user direction)

Pattern: user names the keepers ("leave only A and B"), you delete the rest with `-D` (catches unmerged too). Pass the keepers as args — `main` is always kept:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/housekeeping/lib/branch-sweep.sh <keeper-1> <keeper-2>
```

It fetches `--prune`, deletes every non-keeper, and reports
`SWEEP deleted (...)` + `SWEEP refused (...)`. Refused = in use by a worktree
(built-in git safety) — expected, not an error.

Notes:
- The script leans on git refusing in-use branches rather than pre-filtering —
  refused entries in the report are keepers git protected for you.
- Squash-merged branches don't show under `--merged main`. When the user says
  "merged" they usually mean "PR merged" — use
  `gh pr list --state merged --head <branch>` if you need to verify before
  telling the user a branch is safe to sweep.

## Don'ts

- Don't `git worktree remove -f -f` to override ALIVE-PID locks. Those are running agents.
- Don't delete plans that match active untracked work in the main checkout.
- Don't bulk-delete branches without an explicit keeper list from the user.
- Don't run this inside a worktree owned by another session — run from the primary checkout.
- Don't conflate "remove worktree" with "lose work" in your reporting — committed work survives on the branch ref; only uncommitted dirty files are lost. Be precise so the user can decide.
